This paper seeks to explore the relationship between mode and destination choice in an 
integrated nested choice model. A fundamental argument can be made that in certain 
circumstances, the ordering of choices should be reversed from the usual sequence of 
destination choice preceding mode choice. This results in a travel demand model where 
travelers are more likely to change destinations than to change transportation modes. 
For small and medium size urban areas, particularly in the United States, with less well 
developed public transit systems that draw few choice riders, this assumption makes much 
more sense than the traditional modeling assumptions. The models used in the new travel 
modeling system developed for Knoxville, Tennessee utilize this reversed ordering, with 
generally good results, which required no external tinkering in the logsum parameters.
