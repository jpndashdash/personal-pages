Smartphones have the capability of recording various kinds of data from built-in sensors 
such as GPS in a non-intrusive, systematic way. In transportation studies, such as route 
choice modeling, the discrete sequences of GPS data need to be associated with the 
transportation network to generate meaningful paths. The poor quality of GPS data 
collected from smartphones precludes the use of state of the art map matching methods. In 
this paper, we propose a probabilistic map matching approach. It generates a set of 
potential true paths, and associates a likelihood with each of them. Both spatial (GPS 
coordinates) and temporal information (speed and time) is used to calculate the 
likelihood of the data for a specific path. Applications and analyses on real trips 
illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Also, as an 
application example, a Path-Size Logit model is estimated based on a sample of real 
observations. The estimation results show the viability of applying the proposed method 
in a real route choice modeling context.
