We develop a parameter estimation routine for multinomial logit discrete choice models 
in which one alternative is completely censored, i.e., when one alternative is never 
observed to have been chosen in the estimation data set. Our method is based on 
decomposing the log-likelihood function into marginal and conditional components. Our 
method is computationally efficient, provides consistent parameter estimates, and can 
easily incorporate price and other product attributes. Simulations based on industry 
hotel data demonstrate the superior computational performance of our method over 
alternative estimation methods that are capable of estimating price effects. Because most 
existing revenue management choice-based optimization algorithms do not include price as 
a decision variable, our estimation procedure provides the inputs needed for more 
advanced product portfolio availability and price optimization models.
