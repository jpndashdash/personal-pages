This is a tool for the estimation and application of logit-based discrete choice models.
It is designed to integrate with NumPy and facilitate fast processing of linear models.
If you want to estimate *non-linear* models, try [Biogeme](http://biogeme.epfl.ch/),
which is more flexible in form and can be used for almost any model structure.
If you don't know what the difference is, you probably want to start with linear models.
