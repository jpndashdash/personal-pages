I am a Senior Associate with [Cambridge Systematics](http://www.camsys.com) as well as
a Research Engineer at [Georgia Tech](http://garrowlab.ce.gatech.edu).  I work on
developing travel demand forecasting models for a variety of applications, including
regional and long-distance travel, on the ground and in the air.  I am the lead designer 
and developer of the travel forecasting tools, including risk analysis methodologies, 
used in the California High-Speed Rail Ridership and Revenue Forecasting model.
